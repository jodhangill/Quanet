Quanet is a tool for applying the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to quantitative trading, designed for users who want to leverage advanced trading strategies without needing to write code.

## Features

- **Codeless Interface**: Configure and run NEAT-based trading algorithms without programming.
- **Custom Fitness Functions**: Define your own metrics to evaluate trading strategies, such as Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, total compound returns, and SQN.
- **Flexible Data Selection**: Choose stock data from any stock or time range for testing your strategies.
- **Comprehensive Configuration**: Adjust parameters like max generations, number of hidden nodes, and population size to fine-tune the algorithm.

## How Quanet Works

1. **Define Fitness Function**: Create a function that measures trading strategy performance using metrics like max drawdown and total compound returns.
2. **Select Stock Data**: Choose the stock data and time periods you want to analyze.
3. **Configure NEAT Algorithm**: Set parameters such as max generations, number of hidden nodes, and population size.
4. **Run the Algorithm**: Quanet evaluates and evolves trading strategies over multiple generations based on the configured parameters.
5. **Review Results**: Analyze the top-performing strategy based on the fitness function to make informed trading decisions.

## Getting Started

2. **Configure Your Strategy**: Set up your fitness function, select stock data, and adjust NEAT parameters.
3. **Run Simulations**: Execute the algorithm and monitor real-time updates on strategy performance.
4. **Analyze Results**: Use the output to review and assess the performance of the algorithm.
